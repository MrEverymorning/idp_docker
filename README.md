# idp_docker

This is code I've written to set up a legacy app into containers, which hadn't previously been done.  The app required salt to be installed, which was one of the biggest tricks.  

The idp won't work without proper permissions, but I put the code here to demonstrate my grasp of python SDK, API, containers, and other related tools.  

**removed from this repo are my previous projects with local kubernetes in Kind and Minikube.
